# Bangalore House Price Prediction

Bangalore House Price Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts house prices in Bangalore, India using linear regression. The model was built using Python and the scikit-learn library. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed on the dataset before training the model.

### Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is a collection of house prices and their corresponding features in Bangalore, India. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains 9 columns, including the area of the house, number of bedrooms, and location.

### EDA
Before building the machine learning model, EDA was performed on the dataset to gain insights into the data and identify any outliers or missing values. The EDA process involved visualizing the data using scatter plots, histograms, and box plots. The findings from EDA were used to preprocess the data and prepare it for training the model.

### Model
The machine learning model used for house price prediction is a linear regression model. The model was trained using the preprocessed dataset and achieved an R-squared score of 0.85 on the test set.

### Deployment
The model has been deployed using Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications. The deployed application allows users to input the features of a house and get a predicted price based on the model. 

In the web application, the Price Analysis has also been shown. A user can find a suitable house based on popular locations and price.
